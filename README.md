# Jellyfish Image Classifier using Deep Learning
## Overview
This project aims to classify different species of jellyfish using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow. The model is designed to accurately classify images of various jellyfish species, enabling researchers and enthusiasts to identify different types of jellyfish easily. This repository contains the code for training the model, as well as the necessary scripts to preprocess the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is sourced from various marine biology repositories and consists of high-resolution images of different jellyfish species. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented to ensure the model's robustness and effectiveness in recognizing various features of jellyfish.

## Model Architecture
The image classifier is built using TensorFlow, utilizing a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset, enabling it to learn intricate features and patterns specific to different jellyfish species. The architecture is optimized to achieve high accuracy (80%) and generalizability.

## Usage
To use the image classifier, follow the instructions in the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script. You can input an image of a jellyfish (any of those 6 species of jellyfish), and the model will predict the species based on the learned features. Additionally, the repository contains scripts for retraining the model on custom datasets for specific use cases.

## Installation
To use the project, ensure you have the latest version of TensorFlow installed.

## Contributions
Contributions to the project are welcome. If you find any issues or would like to improve the model's performance, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines provided in the repository.
